Wip - Todo App (TypeScript)
This is a simple Todo app built with TypeScript. It allows users to add, delete, and toggle tasks as completed. The app dynamically renders tasks with a creation date and supports basic task management features. Key features include:

- Add tasks: Enter a task title, which gets added to a list and displayed with the current date.
- Toggle completion: Mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox, which visually updates the task.
- Delete tasks: Select multiple tasks with checkboxes and delete them all at once with a confirm prompt.
- Tasks are stored with an ID, title, completion status, and creation date.


This app demonstrates the use of TypeScript for managing types, handling user input, and dynamically updating the DOM.
